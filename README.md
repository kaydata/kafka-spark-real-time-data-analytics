# Taxi Trip Streaming Analytics
## Project Description
This project leverages Apache Spark and Kafka to perform real-time streaming analytics on taxi trip data. The analytics focus on understanding patterns in trip durations, cost efficiencies, and passenger trends. The system ingests real-time data from a Kafka topic, processes the data using Spark Structured Streaming, and outputs insights through the console.

### Features
- Real-Time Streaming: Analyze taxi trip data as it is generated.
- Trip Duration Analysis: Compute average trip durations by hour of the day.
- Cost Efficiency Analysis: Calculate average cost per mile over time.
- Passenger Trends: Identify trends in passenger counts.
